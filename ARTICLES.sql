Finding the best degree to get has its flaws though; you might find yourself with money, but not satisfied with your job.</p>\r\n<p>Ultimately, you do have to stop and think before you declare your major. We&rsquo;ve researched these degrees and compiled a list from bottom to top to show you the different college degrees that pay.</p>\r\n<h1 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #333333;">6. Nutrition</span></h1>\r\n<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em><img src="../../stories/media/images/fruits-1598767_960_720 (1).jpg" alt="http://whateven.com/stories/media/images/fruits-1598767_960_720 (1).jpg" width="960" height="540" border="0" /></em></span></p>\r\n<p>Love food and good nutrition? Well, nutritionists surround themselves with just that. They advise and tell people what to eat and what not to eat. It seems easy and not that much of a struggle right? Well once you get your nutritional degree you can start making $55,000/year. Not bad. The growth of this industry is at 21% and you don&rsquo;t even have to rely on a career to pay your bills, that&rsquo;s because you can open your own nutritional clinic.</p>\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s not the highest paying degree out there, but it could be the easiest college degree you could get with that kind of salary. Most engineering jobs start off at just barely $55,000, and the amount of work you have to put into Calculus doesn&rsquo;t seem worth it. This is why we are ranking this degree at number 10 of the highest paying bachelor degree.</p>\r\n<h1 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #333333;">5. Computer Engineering</span></h1>\r\n<p><img src="../../stories/media/images/computer-engineering.jpg" width="650" height="432" border="0" /></p>\r\n<p>Now to start off our real list. Computer engineering is a degree and idea of creating computer hardware and chips for them to function in machines. They use some programmatic skills and mostly circuitry to build useful computer parts. It sounds difficult and that&rsquo;s because it is. We wouldn&rsquo;t recommend this degree to anyone not interested in circuitry and computer architecture.<br />[GOOGLE]<br />The starting salary for a computer engineer looking for a job is at $66,000. The in-class struggles seem to be worth it at the end based on the pay. Making computer engineering one of the best bachelor degrees to get!</p>\r\n<h1 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #333333;">4. Finance</span><span style="color: #800000;"><em><br /></em></span></h1>\r\n<p><img src="../../stories/media/images/finance-degree.jpg" alt="finance degree" width="624" height="391" border="0" /></p>\r\n<p>How does this rank better than computer engineering you may ask? Well, in order to be a budget analyst that&rsquo;s what degree you need. It seems like not a high paying degree, but the world is all about supply and demand.</p>\r\n<p>Budget analysts typically make $69,000/year and the effort put into such a degree is not bad.</p>\r\n<p>So what do budget analysts do? They typically organize the finances of private and public institutions. Sounds fun dealing with money right? That&rsquo;s really what you&rsquo;ve been studying in school the whole time!</p>\r\n<p>As we progress deeper in this list, you&rsquo;ll see that the degree doesn&rsquo;t need to be high paying in order for you to get a high paying job.</p>\r\n<h1 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #333333;">3. Mining Engineering</span></h1>\r\n<p><img src="../../stories/media/images/mining-engineering.jpg" alt="mining engineer" width="650" height="379" border="0" /></p>\r\n<p>Mining engineers extract minerals from the Earth using various technologies. They have to have some sort of understanding on how to obtain Earth minerals without damage being resulted. A student typically studying for a mining engineering degree must go through rigorous forms of mathematics and chemistry. After that, 79% of people who work with their mining engineering degrees find that their job changes the world.<br /><br />So if you want a degree that makes you happy in the long run, here&rsquo;s one for you. The average starting salary is $71,000. Which makes it one of the best college degrees to get!</p>\r\n<h1 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #333333;">2. Computer Science</span></h1>\r\n<p><img src="../../stories/media/images/computer-science-degree.jpg" alt="computer science" width="650" height="433" border="0" /></p>\r\n<p>There is a very high demand of computer scientists around the world. From their app making, to their website building. Computer scientists are needed greatly because their supply is so low. Even though computer engineering is a bit more circuitry, computer science only tops it because of the low supply of workers. With a salary of $74,000 a year, it&rsquo;s no wonder getting a degree in computer science pays off greatly!</p>\r\n<p><br />The beauty of this degree is not just in the secure job placement once you graduate, but in how easily you can become a freelancer. While you have a full time job, you can actually work on projects on the side. You can build websites/apps for people and get paid for it. Two incomes easily at your hands.</p>\r\n<h1 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #333333;">1.

Your car, your lawn mower and even the plastics that you use. With this degree, you can land a job as a petroleum engineer. What do they do you may ask? Well, they&rsquo;re involved in almost all the stages of oil production.<br /><br />There are many top paying college degrees, but this one is very unique. The need for oil is increasing and won&rsquo;t go away anytime soon, so big oil companies are paying big money to get people stationed and ready for the black gold production. A petroleum engineer can be paid as much as $101,000 to $168,000 per year.</p>', 'highest-paying-degrees', '', 1, ''),

Our body is working at peak levels and our day begins, but what if we just stopped sleeping after that? What if instead of sleeping, we forced ourselves to stay awake? Is it something we should do? Certainly not.<br /><br />Charlie is confident to do so. Who&rsquo;s Charlie? Well Charlie is just an imaginary person we just made up. What he&rsquo;ll go through isn&rsquo;t though.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://whateven.com/stories/media/images/new-day.jpg" alt="Sun rise" width="850" height="638" /></p>\r\n<h1 class="sub-title" style="text-align: center;"><em><span style="color: #666699;">The Start Of The Day</span></em></h1>\r\n<p>Charlie&rsquo;s day starts with a cup of coffee and a sandwich. The cup of coffee gives Charlie the boost to combat the day&rsquo;s workload. An ordinary day to most people, but today Charlie&rsquo;s coffee crash isn&rsquo;t an ordinary crash. He&rsquo;ll have to fight it because he can&rsquo;t sleep.<br /><br />Already 5 hours in the day, and Charlie is feeling a bit tired. He can still work, but an afternoon nap sounds pretty nice right now. Charlie is not really mad that he can&rsquo;t nap. Why? Well after his 8 hour sleep, Charlie produced dopamine.<br /><br />Dopamine is a chemical produced by the brain that in return causes positivity and will make a person happier. Dopamine is produced by everyone after a goodnight&rsquo;s sleep. Charlie knows he can combat the day a little further, but not for long.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://whateven.com/stories/media/images/lego-recollection.jpg" alt="Lego trashman" width="850" height="568" /></p>\r\n<h1 class="sub-title" style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #666699;"><em>Recollection Mode</em></span></h1>\r\n<p>After 11 hours of no sleep, Charlie&rsquo;s brain begins to sort all the memories he experienced over the course of the day. This recollection mode uses a good amount of energy and will eventually make Charlie&rsquo;s muscles weak and limp. The muscles in his eyelids, legs, and arms will all become drained of energy. This is the initial sign of Charlie&rsquo;s body saying it&rsquo;s time to sleep!<br /><br />Fourteen hours in, and Charlie&rsquo;s brain wants him to turn off the lights. Headaches start to emerge and his eyes look kind of red. The only way to solve this problem is to go to sleep, but let&rsquo;s take Charlie a bit further with 20 hours of no sleep.</p>\r\n<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://whateven.com/stories/media/images/fried-brain.jpg" /></p>\r\n<h1 class="sub-title" style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #666699;"><em>Fried Brain</em></span></h1>\r\n<p>At this point, Charlie&rsquo;s brain can&rsquo;t properly sort the day&rsquo;s events because it&rsquo;s too busy powering his alertness. His body begins to go into protection mode. Headaches start to worsen and Charlie&rsquo;s a mess! After 24 hours of no sleep, it starts to get dangerous. Charlie&rsquo;s reaction time begins to slow down and he also begins to lose his sense of coordination.<br /><br />He limps around begging us to let him sleep, but our imaginary friend needs to stay in a little longer for this article. He tries to fight us, but he can&rsquo;t accurately hit us. He swings and instead hits our small green plant. Charlie trips on his legs, and there you have it.

Mentally he&rsquo;s going crazy, physically he can&rsquo;t move without falling down, and his immune system is also beginning to shut down.<br /><br />With Charlie&rsquo;s immune system shut down, he is now vulnerable to any threat. He is now losing control of his arms and legs and his brain is deprived of energy. He may eat a ton of food, but if he doesn&rsquo;t sleep the food is useless.<br /><br />Day three begins and Charlie is starting to act crazy. He&rsquo;s starting to hallucinate and jump around. He is so deprived of energy that his tongue ceases to move. This isn&rsquo;t coincidence though. The brain needs to cut off communication with this muscle in order to slow down the energy consumption.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://whateven.com/stories/media/images/ugly-dog.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="573" /></p>\r\n<h1 class="sub-title" style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #666699;"><em>Ugly Duckling</em></span></h1>\r\n<p>It is now the fourth day, and Charlie is looking horrible. His appearance is declining and his health isn&rsquo;t looking too good. At this point, Charlie is too worn out to do anything. He lays in bed, however, he can&rsquo;t sense anything. He is unable to function anymore.<br /><br />Lucky for Charlie, he went to sleep and woke up after 10 hours fine! Sleep deprivation does not do any damage to your body, but it does do some damage at the moment.<br /><br />After some days without sleep, you can go to sleep and feel normal afterwards. The longest time a person has gone with no sleep is 11 days, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean you can do it too. A Chinese man tried it and died.

They argue that the government wanted to give Americans reason to infiltrate the Middle East. Others believe that the Bush administration had knowledge prior the attacks.

Would you believe it?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://whateven.com/stories/media/images/cancer-cure-theory.jpg" /></p>\r\n<h1 class="sub-title" style="text-align: center;"><span class="count" style="background-color: #ffff00;">#2</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>Cancer Cure Theory</em></span></h1>\r\n<p>This is a very popular theory. Many people think that there is a cure for cancer, but it is being held by pharmaceutical companies. Why? They believe that these companies wouldn&rsquo;t profit much off of just a cure. Instead, giving the patient multiple treatments and chemo pills is more profitable. Why cure the patient in a day, when you can profit from him/her for many years? Other people believe that Hemp oil from marijuana plants is the cure for cancer, but the government banned the medical use of marijuana for a reason. That reason is to keep the secret away. Even though this is just a theory, many people who are diagnosed with this dreadful illness are taking side with it.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><img src="http://whateven.com/stories/media/images/oil-abundance-theory.jpg" width="850" height="566" /></p>\r\n<h1 class="sub-title" style="text-align: center;"><span class="count" style="background-color: #ffff00;">#1</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>Oil Abundance Theory</em></span></h1>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">We need oil to accomplish many tasks in life, but oil keeps on rising as it keeps getting scarcer. Is it though? Many theorists believe it&rsquo;s not scarce at all. They believe big oil companies are hiding all the oil so they can provide an illusion of it being scarce. Why do that though? Their main incentive is to have a reason to increase oil prices. Even though oil is bought on a supply and demand market, theorists believe supply isn&rsquo;t the problem at all. Next time you pump gas in your car, think about whether or not you&rsquo;d believe this theory.</p>', 'seven-popular-conspiracy-theories', '', 1, ''),

Even though these companies offer a lot, most of them will raise their prices after their introductory phase. It is highly recommended that you test these web hosts before you actually consider buying their premium packages.</p>\r\n<p>As a small business owner, you should consider carefully before purchasing any of these web hosting packages. If you have a problem, your business can''t afford shutting down their website for web host maintenance.</p>\r\n<p>If you are a small site owner and not a small business, then you are recommended to buy something cheap to try before you actually purchase a package.</p>\r\n<p>[GOOGLE]</p>', 'cheap-web-hosting', '', 1, '');

He immediately spoke to it in the languages he knew, including English, but weird enough there was no response at all.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;[GOOGLE]</p>\r\n<p>He apparently got his hand burned as he struggled to scrutinize the <em>&ldquo;colourful glass&rdquo;</em> that was around the object. Terrifying enough, he said that he saw grid-like exhaust vents inside, which even expelled gas that burned his clothes.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><span style="color: #ff0000;">3. La Posada de Santa Fe Resort &amp; Spa Mystery</span></h2>\r\n<p><img src="../../stories/media/images/la-posada-de-santa-fe-resort-spa-mystery.jpeg" alt="La posada de santa fe mystery" width="745" height="400" /></p>\r\n<p>Every hotel has an untold mystery. This resort in New Mexico, which is considered as one of the most historic hotels in the area, was once a 6 acre estate in 1932. It was then later converted into a hotel.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The estate was built in 1882 by a prominent resident, Abraham Staab, who was married to a woman named Lucia. They had 7 children and unfortunately lost their 8<sup>th</sup> child not long after its birth due to an illness.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>They tried to get more children, but Lucia had several unsuccessful pregnancies. She became depressed and was withdrawn from life. It is said that she spent most of her last years isolated in her bedroom.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Sadly, the lady died on May 14, 1986 at the age of 52. When the Staab estate became a hotel, their room became Room 256.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Many people have reported seeing the ghost of the woman, even employees and visitors. Some people have heard voices from inside the room, despite it being empty. The creepiest of all? The phone operators have disconnected the telephone line in the room, but the phone still manages to ring.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><span style="color: #ff0000;">2. Salish Sea Severed Feet</span></h2>\r\n<p><img src="../../stories/media/images/salish-sea-severed-feet.jpg" alt="Salish Sea Severed Feet" width="850" height="567" /></p>\r\n<p>The shores of British Columbia, Canada and Washington, U.S.A have had some <strong>strange </strong>discoveries, but the strangest of all? Detached human feet appearing on the coast. Not just one foot or two feet, we&rsquo;re talking about a dozen feet!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>New feet appear every now and then, but no one knows where the feet come from. The most recent feet discovery was on May 6, 2014.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><span style="color: #ff0000;">1. Mysterious children&rsquo;s death</span></h2>\r\n<p><img src="../../stories/media/images/house-on-fire-mystery.jpg" /></p>\r\n<p>This unsolved mystery is very terrifying, and especially given the fact that it involves young innocent children&rsquo;s lives. It is reported that the parents of 10 children woke up at about 1:00 A.M and found that their house was on fire.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>They successfully saved five of the children, but as they tried to save the remaining other five, weird things started to happen. First, they could not find a ladder that was able to help them climb upstairs. The father of the children also tried to get his two trucks in order to save them, but they could not even start.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;[GOOGLE]</p>\r\n<p>Trying his best to save them, he went to fetch some water from the rain barrel and strange enough, it was all frozen. He tried to call the fire department several times, only to receive no response.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>His neighbor even called and after getting through, the fire fighters took a long while to get to their house until 8 A.M, about 7 hours after the fire&rsquo;s ignition.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>What is more terrifying about this mystery is that even after the fire department investigated the burnt house, they could not retrieve the kids&rsquo; bones. They were all burnt to ashes.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>They could not even identify the cause of the fire, and upon guessing that it was a wiring problem, it turned out that the light bulbs were all still working.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><span style="color: #ff0000;">Conclusion</span></h2>\r\n<p>There are numerous weird things that happen world-wide, some that we hear about and most that we do not. All the same, the number of unsolved mysteries is huge, and we can only hope that the list will grow shorter with time.</p>', 'creepy-unsolved-mysteries', '', 1, '');
